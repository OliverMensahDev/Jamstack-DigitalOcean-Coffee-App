This repo contains sample code for a GenAI tutorial that teaches users how to intergrate GenAI platform into their web application using DigitalOcean cloud.

Once you complete the tutorial, the sample website contains:

*  A static HTML website that uses CSS Bootstrap elements for styling and Axios to invoke the DigitalOcean functions. The site contains a few JS scripts to dynamically render content.
* DigitalOcean Serverless Functions (written in node) as a replacement for traditional backend APIs. The functions retrieve content from a MongoDB and render it on a static HTML page.
* A chatbot feature that uses DigitalOcean GenAI platform leveraging on DigitalOcean Serverless Functions to retrieve information for the chatbot interaction
